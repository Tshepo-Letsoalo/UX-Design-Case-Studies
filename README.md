# ✍️ UX Design Principles and Process Repository

This repository serves as an overview of my proficiency in the end-to-end UX design process, guided by the **Google UX Design Professional Certificate** curriculum. I am committed to designing accessible, useful, and user-centric digital experiences.

## 💡 The Design Thinking Process

I adhere to a robust, iterative design thinking methodology to ensure all solutions are anchored in user needs and tested thoroughly. 




| Phase | Core Goal | Key Activities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Empathize** | Understand user needs and pain points. | User Interviews, Surveys, Competitive Audits, Creating Personas. |
| **Define** | Clearly state the user problem. | Writing Problem Statements, User Stories, and establishing HMW (How Might We) questions. |
| **Ideate** | Brainstorm creative solutions. | Sketching, Crazy Eights, Storyboarding. |
| **Prototype** | Create tangible representations of designs. | Low-fidelity (paper) and High-fidelity (digital, interactive) prototypes (Figma, Adobe XD). |
| **Test** | Evaluate the prototype with users. | Usability Studies, A/B Testing, Synthesizing Test Findings, and Iteration. |
